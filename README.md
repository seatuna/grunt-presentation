# Grunt Presentation

## What is Grunt.js?

Grunt is a JavaScript task runner.  Developers often have to do repetitive tasks
whether it's during production or in preparation for deployment.  To save time
and effort, Grunt can automate these tasks for you!  Grunt allows you to create
tasks that can be run in the command line.  Similar to when we defined a rake
task in Postgres to quickly populate our database, or when we run db:nuke_pave
(not a task native to rake), we must tell Grunt what to do when we type in the
command.
